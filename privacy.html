            <h3>Legal Basis for Data Processing</h3>
            <p class="txt">
              We process Personal Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy
              Policy, as described above. Our legal basis to process personal
              data includes processing that is: necessary for the performance of
              the contract with you (for example, to provide you with the
              services you request and to identify and authenticate you so you
              may use the Sites); necessary to comply with legal requirements
              (for example, to comply with applicable accounting rules and to
              make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement); necessary for our
              legitimate interests (for example, to manage our relationship with
              you, to ensure the security of our services, to communicate with
              you about our products and services); and based on consent by our
              customers (for example, to place certain cookies and to share your
              information with third parties for advertising purposes).
            </p>
            <h3>International Transfers of Personal Data</h3>
            <p class="txt">
              Our business may require us to transfer your Personal Data to
              countries outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"), including
              to countries such as the People's Republic of China or Singapore.
              We take appropriate steps to ensure that recipients of your
              Personal Data are bound to duties of confidentiality and we
              implement measures such as standard contractual clauses. A copy of
              those clauses can be obtained by contacting our Help Center.

              object to or request the restriction of processing of your
              Personal Data, and to request access to, rectification, erasure

              If you are aware of changes or inaccuracies in your information,

              authority if you consider that our processing of your Personal
              Data infringes applicable law.
